## How to setup Salesforce VSCode integration

### Installation
Follow the steps at: [https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/getting-started/install](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/getting-started/install)

After following these steps you should have installed the following:

* JDK 11
* Salesforce VSCode extensions
* Salesforce CLI

### Configuration
Set the JDK path for the Salesforce Extension:

Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Salesforce Apex Configuration > Java: Home

Set to the path where JDK 11 installed e.g. `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home`

Setup a new project by going to:

View > Command Palette > SFDX: Create Project

From the resulting workspace open the file `sfdx-project.json`
Edit the value of `"sfdcLoginUrl"` to `"https://test.salesforce.com"` (assuming you want to checkout the Sandbox code).

From the blue bar at the bottom of the VSCode window click 'No Default Org Set' click 'SFDX: Authorize an Org'

Follow the steps in your browser to login to the sandbox

Back in VSCode click 'No Default Org Set' and switch to the org created by the previous step

Terminal > New Terminal 

From the terminal run in your workspace directory run: `sfdx force:source:retrieve -m ApexClass` 

The Apex classes should now be available at `force-app/main/default/classes`.
